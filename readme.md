` aquamarine `

## Initial idea:
Tool for recognitions/detections/analyzing images, for searching differences in pictures, can help in the detection of movement, appearances/disappearances of objects, change of weather/light conditions.

## Target: 
Find optimal solutions for implementation and figure out how to make recognition of image characteristics in an appropriate form and inside of predefined limitations in a config file. Parameters in the config file should cover all significant properties of calculation and should be taken into consideration target Platform and HW limitations. Every improvement ideas are welcome!


### How does it work, what is the result of the comparison
The result of the comparison is a rectangle area(s) that shows a possible object, an area where the color change is being detected. Aquamarine is able to detect person movement and skip such a small movement as it is with grass or tree leaves.
The testing stage has not been performed yet.
